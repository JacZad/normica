# 3 Definition of terms, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Terms
For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in ETSI EG 201 013 and the following apply:
**accessibility:** extent to which products, systems, services, environments and facilities can be used by people from a population with the widest range of user needs, characteristics and capabilities, to achieve identified goals in identified contexts of use (from ISO 9241-11:2018 )
**NOTE 1:** Context of use includes direct use or use supported by assistive technologies.
**NOTE 2:** The context in which the ICT is used may affect its overall accessibility. This context could include other products and services with which the ICT may interact.
**access space:** space intended to be occupied by the person, including their Assistive Technology, while they are using the product
**Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs):** devices that help separate the sounds, particularly speech, that a person wants to hear from background noise by bringing sound directly into the ear
**NOTE:** These are often found in meetings and public venues such as plays, concerts and places of worship. They can also be used at home with televisions and other products with auditory output.
**Assistive Technology (AT):** equipment, product system, hardware, software or service that is used to increase, maintain or improve capabilities of individuals (from ISO/IEC Guide 71:2014 )
**NOTE 1:** Assistive technology is an umbrella term that is broader than assistive products.
**NOTE 2:** Assistive technology can include assistive services, and professional services needed for assessment, recommendation and provision. assistive technology) can also be considered assistive technology. This is an additional note, not included in ISO/IEC Guide 71:2014 .
**audio description:** additional audible narrative, interleaved with the dialogue, which describes the significant aspects of the visual content of audio-visual media that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone
**NOTE:** This is also variously described using terms such as "video description" or variants such as "descriptive narration".
**authoring tool:** software that can be used to create or modify content
**NOTE 1:** An authoring tool may be used by a single user or multiple users working collaboratively.
**NOTE 2:** An authoring tool may be a single stand-alone application or be comprised of collections of applications.
**NOTE 3:** An authoring tool may produce content that is intended for further modification or for use by end-users.
**caption:** synchronized visual and/or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content (after WCAG 2.1 [5])
**NOTE:** This is also variously described using terms such as "subtitles" or variants such as "subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing".
**closed functionality:** functionality that is limited by characteristics that prevent a user from attaching, installing or using assistive technology
**content:** information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of software, including code or mark-up that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions (after WCAG2ICT )
**NOTE:** Content occurs in three places: web pages, documents and software. When content occurs in a web page or a document, a user agent is needed in order to communicate the content's information and sensory experience to the user. When content occurs in software, a separate user agent is not needed in order to communicate the content's information and sensory experience to the user - the software itself performs that function.
**context of use:** combination of users, goals and tasks, resources, and environment. (from ISO 9241-11:2018 )
**NOTE:** The "environment" in a context of use includes the technical, physical, social, cultural and organizational environments.
**document:** logically distinct assembly of content (such as a file, set of files, or streamed media) that functions as a single entity rather than a collection, that is not part of software and that does not include its own user agent (after WCAG2ICT )
**NOTE 1:** A document always requires a user agent to present its content to the user.
**NOTE 2:** Letters, e-mail messages, spreadsheets, books, pictures, presentations, and movies are examples of documents.
**NOTE 3:** Software configuration and storage files such as databases and virus definitions, as well as computer instruction files such as source code, batch/script files, and firmware, are examples of files that function as part of software and thus are not examples of documents. If and where software retrieves "information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user" from such files, it is just another part of the content that occurs in software and is covered by WCAG2ICT like any other parts of the software. Where such files contain one or more embedded documents, the embedded documents remain documents under this definition.
**NOTE 4:** A collection of files zipped together into an archive, stored within a single virtual hard drive file, or stored in a single encrypted file system file, do not constitute a single document when so collected together. The software that archives/encrypts those files or manages the contents of the virtual hard drive does not function as a user agent for the individually collected files in that collection because that software is not providing a fully functioning presentation of that content.
**NOTE 5:** Anything that can present its own content without involving a user agent, such as a self-playing book, is not a document but is software.
**NOTE 6:** A single document may be composed of multiple files such as the video content and closed caption text. This fact is not usually apparent to the end-user consuming the document/content.
**NOTE 7:** An assembly of files that represented the video, audio, captions and timing files for a movie is an example of a document.
**NOTE 8:** A binder file used to bind together the various exhibits for a legal case would not be a document.
**NOTE 9:** Documents may contain sub-documents.
**embedded:** directly included in the content that is downloaded to the user agent and its extension, and is intended to be used in rendering the web page
**NOTE:** Something that is downloaded using a mechanism on the web page but is not used in rendering the page is not "embedded" in the page.
**ICT network:** technology and resources supporting the connection and operation of interconnected ICT
**Information and Communication Technology (ICT):** technology, equipment, or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment for which the principal function is the creation, conversion, duplication, automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, reception, or broadcast of data or information
**NOTE:** Examples of ICT are web pages, electronic content, telecommunications products, computers and ancillary equipment, software including mobile applications, information kiosks and transaction machines, videos, IT services, and multifunction office machines which copy, scan, and fax documents.
**mechanically operable part:** operable part that has a mechanical interface to activate, deactivate, or adjust the ICT
**NOTE:** Examples of mechanically operable parts include scanner covers, notebook docking stations and lids as well as physical switches and latches.
**mechanism for private listening:** auditory output designed so that only the current user can receive the sound
**NOTE:** Personal headsets, directional speakers and audio hoods are examples of mechanisms for private listening.
**non-text content:** content that is not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is not expressing something in human language (after WCAG 2.1 [5])
**non-web document:** document that is not a web page, not embedded in web pages nor used in the rendering or functioning of the page
**non-web software:** software that is not a web page, not embedded in web pages nor used in the rendering or functioning of the page
**open functionality:** functionality that supports access by assistive technology
**NOTE:** This is the opposite of closed functionality.
**operable part:** component of ICT used to activate, deactivate, or adjust the ICT
**NOTE 1:** Operable parts can be provided in either hardware (see mechanically operable parts, above) or software. An on-screen button is an example of an operable part provided by software.
**NOTE 2:** Operable parts do not include parts involved only in maintenance or repair or other actions that are not expected of a typical user if the product is not malfunctioning. These actions include: clearing paper jams internal to the machine, replacing items or parts internal to the machine that may expose the end user to sharp or hot surfaces, replacing or repairing items designated by manufacturers as service or maintenance items in user documentation.
**platform software (platform):** collection of software components that runs on an underlying software or hardware layer, and that provides a set of software services to other software components that allows those applications to be isolated from the underlying software or hardware layer (after ISO/IEC 13066-1 )
**NOTE:** A particular software component might play the role of a platform in some situations and a client in others.
**programmatically determinable:** able to be read by software from developer-supplied data in a way that other software, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities
**NOTE:** WCAG 2.1 uses "determined" where this definition uses "able to be read" (to avoid ambiguity with the word "determined").
**Real-Time Text (RTT):** form of a text conversation in point to point situations or in multipoint conferencing where the text being entered is sent in such a way that the communication is perceived by the user as being continuous
**NOTE 1:** Users will perceive communication as continuous if the delay between text being created by the sender and received by the recipient is less than 500 ms. However, the actual delay will be dependent on the communication network.
**NOTE 2:** The creation of text will differ between systems where text is entered on a word-by-word basis (e.g. speech‑to‑text and predictive-text based systems) and systems where each character is separately generated (e.g. typing on a physical keyboard).
**satisfies a success criterion:** success criterion does not evaluate to "false" when applied to the ICT (after WCAG 2.1 [5])
**single user connection:** connection that consists of sound, RTT or video (or a combination of two or three of those media) that is established by a single user action
**NOTE:** Even though the different media may travel over different channels, and more than one piece of hardware may be involved, it appears to the user like a single connection, and is treated by any intermediate technologies (e.g. network, auto-reception) as a single connection for purposes such as transfer.
**spoken captions/subtitles audio captions/subtitles:** captions/subtitles that are voiced over the audiovisual content (from ISO/IEC TS 20071-25 )
**stationary ICT:** ICT that stands on the floor, or is mounted on a wall or other immovable structure, and is not intended to be moved by its user
**NOTE 1:** Typically, stationary ICT rests on the ground (such as an information kiosk) or is installed in a wall (such as a machine that dispenses cash or performs other banking services).
**NOTE 2:** A manufacturer cannot control the height of ICT that is put on a table by someone else, but they are able to control the reach dimensions of self-contained ICT that rests on the ground and can specify the heights for installation in walls.
**terminal:** combination of hardware and/or software with which the end user directly interacts and that provides the user interface
**NOTE 1:** The hardware may consist of more than one device working together e.g. a mobile device and a computer.
**NOTE 2:** For some systems, the software that provides the user interface may reside on more than one device such as a telephone and a server.
**turn-taking:** type of organization in conversation and discourse where participants speak one at a time in alternating turns
**user agent:** software that retrieves and presents content for users (after WCAG 2.1 [5])
**NOTE 1:** Software that only displays the content contained within it is treated as software and not considered to be a user agent.
**NOTE 2:** An example of software that is not a user agent is a calculator application that does not retrieve the calculations from outside the software to present it to a user. In this case, the calculator software is not a user agent, it is simply software with a user interface.
**NOTE 3:** Software that only shows a preview of content such as a thumbnail or other non-fully functioning presentation is not providing user agent functionality.
**user interface:** all components of an interactive system (software or hardware) that provide information and/or controls for the user to accomplish specific tasks with the interactive system (from ISO 9241-110 )
**user interface element:** entity of the user interface that is presented to the user by the software (after ISO 9241-171 )
**NOTE 1:** This term is also known as "user interface component".
**NOTE 2:** User-interface elements can be interactive or not.
**web content:** content that belongs to a web page, and that is used in the rendering or that is intended to be used in the rendering of the web page
**web page:** non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent (after WCAG 2.1 [5])

# 5 Generic requirements
## 5.1 Closed functionality
### 5.1.1 Introduction (informative)
ICT has closed functionality for many reasons, including design or policy. Some of the functionality of products can be closed because the product is self-contained and users are precluded from adding peripherals or software in order to access that functionality.
ICT may have closed functionality in practice even though the ICT was not designed, developed or supplied to be closed.
Computers that do not allow end-users to adjust settings or install software are functionally closed.

### 5.1.2 General
#### 5.1.2.1 Closed functionality
Where ICT has closed functionality, it shall meet the requirements set out in clauses 5.2 to 13, as applicable.
**NOTE 1:** ICT may close some, but not all, of its functionalities. Only the closed functionalities have to conform to the requirements of clause 5.1.
**NOTE 2:** The requirements within this clause replace those in clauses 5.2 to 13 that specifically state that they do not apply to closed functionality. This may be because they relate to compatibility with assistive technology or to the ability for the user to adjust system accessibility settings in products with closed functionality (e.g. products that prevent access to the system settings control panel).

#### 5.1.2.2 Assistive technology
Where ICT has closed functionality, that closed functionality shall be operable without requiring the user to attach, connect or install assistive technology and shall conform to the generic requirements of clauses 5.1.3 to 5.1.6 as applicable. Personal headsets and personal induction loops shall not be classed as assistive technology for the purpose of this clause.

### 5.1.3 Non-visual access
#### 5.1.3.1 Audio output of visual information
Where visual information is needed to enable the use of those functions of ICT that are closed to assistive technologies for screen reading, ICT shall provide at least one mode of operation using non-visual access to enable the use of those functions.
**NOTE 1:** Non-visual access may be in an audio form, including speech, or a tactile form such as braille for deaf- blind users.
**NOTE 2:** The visual information needed to enable use of some functions may include operating instructions and orientation, transaction prompts, user input verification, error messages and non-text content.

#### 5.1.3.2 Auditory output delivery including speech
Where auditory output is provided as non-visual access to closed functionality, the auditory output shall be delivered:
a. either directly by a mechanism included in or provided with the ICT; or
b. by a personal headset that can be connected through a 3,5 mm audio jack, or an industry standard connection, without requiring the use of vision.
**NOTE 1:** Mechanisms included in or provided with ICT may be, but are not limited to, a loudspeaker, a built-in handset/headset, or other industry standard coupled peripheral.
**NOTE 2:** An industry standard connection could be a wireless connection.
**NOTE 3:** Some users may benefit from the provision of an inductive loop.

#### 5.1.3.3 Auditory output correlation
Where auditory output is provided as non-visual access to closed functionality, and where information is displayed on the screen, the ICT should provide auditory information that allows the user to correlate the audio with the information displayed on the screen.
**NOTE 1:** Many people who are legally blind still have visual ability, and use aspects of the visual display even if it cannot be fully comprehended. An audio alternative that is both complete and complementary includes all visual information such as focus or highlighting, so that the audio can be correlated with information that is visible on the screen at any point in time.
**NOTE 2:** Examples of auditory information that allows the user to correlate the audio with the information displayed on the screen include structure and relationships conveyed through presentation.

#### 5.1.3.4 Speech output user control
Where speech output is provided as non-visual access to closed functionality, the speech output shall be capable of being interrupted and repeated when requested by the user, where permitted by security requirements.
**NOTE 1:** It is best practice to allow the user to pause speech output rather than just allowing them to interrupt it.
**NOTE 2:** It is best practice to allow the user to repeat only the most recent portion rather than requiring play to start from the beginning.

#### 5.1.3.5 Speech output automatic interruption
Where speech output is provided as non-visual access to closed functionality, the ICT shall interrupt current speech output when a user action occurs and when new speech output begins.
**NOTE:** Where it is essential that the user hears the entire message, e.g. a safety instruction or warning, the ICT may need to block all user action so that speech is not interrupted.

#### 5.1.3.6 Speech output for non-text content
Where ICT presents non-text content, the alternative for non-text content shall be presented to users via speech output unless the non-text content is pure decoration or is used only for visual formatting. The speech output for non-text content shall follow the guidance for "text alternative" described in WCAG 2.1 [5] Success Criterion 1.1.1.

#### 5.1.3.7 Speech output for video information
Where pre-recorded video content is needed to enable the use of closed functions of ICT and where speech output is provided as non-visual access to closed functionality, the speech output shall present equivalent information for the pre-recorded video content.
**NOTE:** This speech output can take the form of an audio description or an auditory transcript of the video content.

#### 5.1.3.8 Masked entry
Where auditory output is provided as non-visual access to closed functionality, and the characters displayed are masking characters, the auditory output shall not be a spoken version of the characters entered unless the auditory output is known to be delivered only to a mechanism for private listening, or the user explicitly chooses to allow non-private auditory output.
**NOTE 1:** Masking characters are usually displayed for security purposes and include, but are not limited to asterisks representing personal identification numbers.
**NOTE 2:** Unmasked character output might be preferred when closed functionality is used, for example, in the privacy of the user's home. A warning highlighting privacy concerns might be appropriate to ensure that the user has made an informed choice.

#### 5.1.3.9 Private access to personal data
Where auditory output is provided as non-visual access to closed functionality, and the output contains data that is considered to be private according to the applicable privacy policy, the corresponding auditory output shall only be delivered through a mechanism for private listening that can be connected without requiring the use of vision, or through any other mechanism explicitly chosen by the user.
**NOTE 1:** This requirement does not apply in cases where data is not defined as being private according to the applicable privacy policy or where there is no applicable privacy policy.
**NOTE 2:** Non-private output might be preferred when closed functionality is used, for example, in the privacy of the user's home. A warning highlighting privacy concerns might be appropriate to ensure that the user has made an informed choice.

#### 5.1.3.10 Non-interfering audio output
Where auditory output is provided as non-visual access to closed functionality, the ICT shall not automatically play, at the same time, any interfering audible output that lasts longer than three seconds.

#### 5.1.3.11 Private listening volume
Where auditory output is provided as non-visual access to closed functionality and is delivered through a mechanism for private listening, ICT shall provide at least one non-visual mode of operation for controlling the volume.

#### 5.1.3.12 Speaker volume
Where auditory output is provided as non-visual access to closed functionality and is delivered through speakers on ICT, a non-visual incremental volume control shall be provided with output amplification up to a level of at least 65 dBA (-29 dBPaA).
**NOTE:** For noisy environments, 65 dBA may not be sufficient.

#### 5.1.3.13 Volume reset
Where auditory output is provided as non-visual access to closed functionality, a function that resets the volume to be at a level of 65 dBA or less after every use, shall be provided, unless the ICT is dedicated to a single user.
**NOTE:** A feature to disable the volume reset function may be provided in order to enable the single-user exception to be met.

#### 5.1.3.14 Spoken languages
Where speech output is provided as non-visual access to closed functionality, speech output shall be in the same human language as the displayed content provided, except:
a. for proper names, technical terms, words of indeterminate language, and words or phrases that have become part of the vernacular of the immediately surrounding text;
b. where the content is generated externally and not under the control of the ICT vendor, the present clause shall not be required to apply for languages not supported by the ICT's speech synthesizer;
c. for displayed languages that cannot be selected using non-visual access;
d. where the user explicitly selects a speech language that is different from the language of the displayed content.

#### 5.1.3.15 Non-visual error identification
Where speech output is provided as non-visual access to closed functionality and an input error is automatically detected, speech output shall identify and describe the item that is in error.

#### 5.1.3.16 Receipts, tickets, and transactional outputs
Where ICT is closed to visual access and provides receipts, tickets or other outputs as a result of a self-service transaction, speech output shall be provided which shall include all information necessary to complete or verify the transaction. In the case of ticketing machines, printed copies of itineraries and maps shall not be required to be audible.
**NOTE:** The speech output may be provided by any element of the total ICT system.

### 5.1.4 Functionality closed to text enlargement
Where any functionality of ICT is closed to the text enlargement features of platform or assistive technology, the ICT shall provide a mode of operation where the text and images of text necessary for all functionality is displayed in such a way that a non-accented capital "H" subtends an angle of at least 0,7 degrees at a viewing distance specified by the supplier.
The subtended angle, in degrees, may be calculated from:
Ψ = (180 x H) / (π x D)
Where:
* ψ is the subtended angle in degrees
* H is the height of the text
* D is the viewing distance
* D and H are expressed in the same units
**NOTE 1:** The intent is to provide a mode of operation where text is large enough to be used by most users with low vision.
**NOTE 2:** Table 5.1 and Figure 1 illustrate the relationship between the maximum viewing distance and minimum character height at the specified minimum subtended angle.
Table 5.1: Relationship between maximum design viewing distance and minimum character height at the limit of subtended angle
Minimum subtended angle | Maximum design viewing distance | Minimum character height
--- | --- | ---
0,7 degrees | 100 mm | 1,2 mm
| 200 mm | 2,4 mm
| 250 mm | 3,1 mm
| 300 mm | 3,7 mm
| 350 mm | 4,3 mm
| 400 mm | 4,9 mm
| 450 mm | 5,5 mm
| 500 mm | 6,1 mm
| 550 mm | 6,7 mm
| 600 mm | 7,3 mm
Figure 1: Relationship between minimum character height and maximum design viewing distance

### 5.1.5 Visual output for auditory information
Where auditory information is needed to enable the use of closed functions of ICT, the ICT shall provide visual information that is equivalent to the auditory output.
**NOTE:** This visual information can take the form of captions or text transcripts.

### 5.1.6 Operation without keyboard interface
#### 5.1.6.1 Closed functionality
Where ICT functionality is closed to keyboards or keyboard interfaces, all functionality shall be operable without vision as required by clause 5.1.3.

#### 5.1.6.2 Input focus
Where ICT functionality is closed to keyboards or keyboard interfaces and where input focus can be moved to a user interface element, it shall be possible to move the input focus away from that element using the same mechanism, in order to avoid trapping the input focus.

### 5.1.7 Access without speech
Where speech is needed to operate closed functions of ICT, the ICT shall provide at least one mode of operation using an alternative input mechanism that does not require speech.

## 5.2 Activation of accessibility features
Where ICT has documented accessibility features, it shall be possible to activate those documented accessibility features that are required to meet a specific need without relying on a method that does not support that need.

## 5.3 Biometrics
Where ICT uses biological characteristics, it shall not rely on the use of a particular biological characteristic as the only means of user identification or for control of ICT.
**NOTE 1:** Alternative means of user identification or for control of ICT could be non-biometric or biometric.
**NOTE 2:** Biometric methods based on dissimilar biological characteristics increase the likelihood that individuals with disabilities possess at least one of the specified biological characteristics. Examples of dissimilar biological characteristics are fingerprints, eye retinal patterns, voice, and face.

## 5.4 Preservation of accessibility information during conversion
Where ICT converts information or communication it shall preserve all documented non-proprietary information that is provided for accessibility, to the extent that such information can be contained in or supported by the destination format.

## 5.5 Operable parts
### 5.5.1 Means of operation
Where ICT has operable parts that require grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist to operate, an accessible alternative means of operation that does not require these actions shall be provided.

### 5.5.2 Operable parts discernibility
Where ICT has operable parts, it shall provide a means to discern each operable part, without requiring vision and without performing the action associated with the operable part.
**NOTE:** One way of meeting this requirement is by making the operable parts tactilely discernible.

## 5.6 Locking or toggle controls
### 5.6.1 Tactile or auditory status
Where ICT has a locking or toggle control and the status of that control is visually presented to the user, the ICT shall provide at least one mode of operation where the status of the control can be determined either through touch or sound without operating the control.
**NOTE 1:** Locking or toggle controls are those controls that can only have two or three states and that keep their state while being used.
**NOTE 2:** An example of a locking or toggle control is the "Caps Lock" key found on most keyboards. Another example is the volume button on a pay telephone, which can be set at normal, loud, or extra loud volume.

### 5.6.2 Visual status
Where ICT has a locking or toggle control and the status of the control is non-visually presented to the user, the ICT shall provide at least one mode of operation where the status of the control can be visually determined when the control is presented.
**NOTE 1:** Locking or toggle controls are those controls that can only have two or three states and that keep their state while being used.
**NOTE 2:** An example of a locking or toggle control is the "Caps Lock" key found on most keyboards. An example of making the status of a control determinable is a visual status indicator on a keyboard.

## 5.7 Key repeat
Where ICT has a key repeat function that cannot be turned off:
a. the delay before the key repeat shall be adjustable to at least 2 seconds; and
b. the key repeat rate shall be adjustable down to one character per 2 seconds.

## 5.8 Double-strike key acceptance
Where ICT has a keyboard or keypad, the delay after any keystroke, during which an additional key-press will not be accepted if it is identical to the previous keystroke, shall be adjustable up to at least 0,5 seconds.

## 5.9 Simultaneous user actions
Where ICT has a mode of operation requiring simultaneous user actions for its operation, such ICT shall provide at least one mode of operation that does not require simultaneous user actions to operate the ICT.
**NOTE:** Having to use both hands to open the lid of a laptop, having to press two or more keys at the same time or having to touch a surface with more than one finger are examples of simultaneous user actions.

# 6 ICT with two-way voice communication
## 6.1 Audio bandwidth for speech
Where ICT provides two-way voice communication, in order to provide good audio quality, that ICT shall be able to encode and decode two-way voice communication with a frequency range with an upper limit of at least 7 000 Hz.
**NOTE 1:** For the purposes of interoperability, support of Recommendation ITU-T G.722 is widely used.
**NOTE 2:** Where codec negotiation is implemented, other standardized codecs such as Recommendation ITU-T G.722.2 are sometimes used so as to avoid transcoding.

## 6.2 Real-Time Text (RTT) functionality
### 6.2.1 RTT provision
#### 6.2.1.1 RTT communication
Where ICT is in a mode that provides a means for two-way voice communication, the ICT shall provide a means for two-way RTT communication, except where this would require design changes to add input or output hardware to the ICT.
**NOTE 1:** This requirement includes those products which do not have physical display or text entry capabilities but have the capability to connect to devices that do have such capabilities. It also includes intermediate ICT between the endpoints of the communication.
**NOTE 2:** There is no requirement to add: a hardware display, a hardware keyboard, or hardware to support the ability to connect to a display or keyboard, wired or wirelessly, if this hardware would not normally be provided.
**NOTE 3:** For the purposes of interoperability, support of Recommendation ITU-T T.140 is widely used.

#### 6.2.1.2 Concurrent voice and text
Where ICT provides a means for two-way voice communication and for users to communicate by RTT, it shall allow concurrent voice and text through a single user connection.
**NOTE 1:** With many-party communication, as in a conference system, it is allowed (but not required or necessarily recommended) that RTT be handled in a single display field and that "turn-taking" be necessary to avoid confusion (in the same way that turn-taking is required for those presenting/talking with voice).
**NOTE 2:** With many-party communication, best practice is for hand-raising for voice users and RTT users to be handled in the same way, so that voice and RTT users are in the same queue.
**NOTE 3:** With a many-party conference system that has chat as one of its features - the RTT (like the voice) would typically be separate from the chat so that RTT use does not interfere with chat (i.e. people can be messaging in the chat field while the person is presenting/talking with RTT - in the same manner that people message using the chat feature while people are talking with voice). RTT users would then use RTT for presenting and use the Chat feature to message while others are presenting (via Voice or RTT).
**NOTE 4:** The availability of voice and RTT running concurrently (and separately from chat) can also allow the RTT field to support text captioning when someone is speaking (and it is therefore not being used for RTT since it is not the RTT user's turn to speak).
**NOTE 5:** Where both server-side software and local hardware and software are required to provide voice communication, where neither part can support voice communication without the other and are sold as a unit for the voice communication function, the local and server-side components are considered a single product.

### 6.2.2 Display of RTT
#### 6.2.2.1 Visually distinguishable display
Where ICT has RTT send and receive capabilities, displayed sent text shall be visually differentiated from, and separated from, received text.
**NOTE:** The ability of the user to choose between having the send and receive text be displayed in-line or separately, and with options to select, allows users to display RTT in a form that works best for them. This would allow Braille users to use a single field and take turns and have text appear in the sequential way that they may need or prefer.

#### 6.2.2.2 Programmatically determinable send and receive direction
Where ICT has RTT send and receive capabilities, the send/receive direction of transmitted/received text shall be programmatically determinable, unless the RTT is implemented as closed functionality.
**NOTE:** This enables screen readers to distinguish between incoming text and outgoing text when used with RTT functionality.

#### 6.2.2.3 Speaker identification
Where ICT has RTT capabilities, and provides speaker identification for voice, the ICT shall provide speaker identification for RTT.
**NOTE:** This is necessary to enable both voice and RTT participants to know who is currently communicating, whether it be in RTT or voice.

#### 6.2.2.4 Visual indicator of Audio with RTT
Where ICT provides two-way voice communication, and has RTT capabilities, the ICT shall provide a real-time visual indicator of audio activity on the display.
**NOTE 1:** The visual indicator may be a simple character position on the display that flickers on and off to reflect audio activity, or presentation of the information in another way that can be both visible to sighted users and passed on to deaf-blind users who are using a braille display.
**NOTE 2:** Without this indication a person who lacks the ability to hear does not know when someone is talking.

### 6.2.3 Interoperability
Where ICT with RTT functionality interoperates with other ICT with RTT functionality (as required by clause 6.2.1.1) they shall support the applicable RTT interoperability mechanisms described below:
a. ICT interoperating with other ICT directly connected to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), using Recommendation ITU-T V.18 or any of its annexes for text telephony signals at the PSTN interface;
b. ICT interoperating with other ICT using VOIP with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and using RTT that conforms to IETF RFC 4103 . For ICT interoperating with other ICT using the IP Multimedia Sub-System (IMS) to implement VOIP, the set of protocols specified in ETSI TS 126 114 , ETSI TS 122 173 and ETSI TS 134 229 describe how IETF RFC 4103 would apply;
c. ICT interoperating with other ICT using technologies other than a or b, above, using a relevant and applicable common specification for RTT exchange that is published and available for the environments in which they will be operating. This common specification shall include a method for indicating loss or corruption of characters;
d. ICT interoperating with other ICT using a standard for RTT that has been introduced for use in any of the above environments, and is supported by all of the other active ICT that support voice and RTT in that environment.
**NOTE 1:** In practice, new standards are introduced as an alternative codec/protocol that is supported alongside the existing common standard and used when all end-to-end components support it while technology development, combined with other reasons including societal development and cost efficiency, may make others become obsolete.
**NOTE 2:** Where multiple technologies are used to provide voice communication, multiple interoperability mechanisms may be needed to ensure that all users are able to use RTT.
**EXAMPLE:** A conferencing system that supports voice communication through an internet connection might provide RTT over an internet connection using a proprietary RTT method (option c). However, regardless of whether the RTT method is proprietary or non-proprietary, if the conferencing system also offers telephony communication it will also need to support options a or b to ensure that RTT is supported over the telephony connection.

### 6.2.4 RTT responsiveness
Where ICT utilises RTT input, that RTT input shall be transmitted to the ICT network or platform on which the ICT runs within 500 ms of the time that the smallest reliably composed unit of text entry is available to the ICT for transmission. Delays due to platform or network performance shall not be included in the 500 ms limit.
**NOTE 1:** For character by character input, the "smallest reliably composed unit of text entry" would be a character. For word prediction it would be a word. For some voice recognition systems - the text may not exit the recognition software until an entire word (or phrase) has been spoken. In this case, the smallest reliably composed unit of text entry available to the ICT would be the word (or phrase).
**NOTE 2:** The 500 ms limit allows buffering of characters for this period before transmission so character by character transmission is not required unless the characters are generated more slowly than 1 per 500 ms.
**NOTE 3:** A delay of 300 ms, or less, produces a better impression of flow to the user.

## 6.3 Caller ID
Where ICT provides caller identification or similar telecommunications functions, the caller identification and similar telecommunications functions shall be available in text form as well as being programmatically determinable, unless the functionality is closed.

## 6.4 Alternatives to voice-based services
Where ICT provides real-time voice-based communication and also provides voice mail, auto-attendant, or interactive voice response facilities, the ICT shall offer users a means to access the information and carry out the tasks provided by the ICT without the use of hearing or speech.
**NOTE 1:** Tasks that involve both operating the interface and perceiving the information would require that both the interface and information be accessible without use of speech or hearing.
**NOTE 2:** Solutions capable of handling audio, RTT and video media could satisfy the above requirement.

## 6.5 Video communication
### 6.5.1 General (informative)
Clause 6.5 (Video communications) provides performance requirements that support users who communicate using sign language and lip-reading. For these users, good usability is achieved with a resolution of at least Quarter Video Graphics Array (QVGA, 320 x 240), a frame rate of 20 frames per second and over, with a time difference between speech audio and video that does not exceed 100 ms.
Increasing the resolution and frame rate further improves both sign language (especially finger spelling) and lipreading, with frame rate being more important than resolution.
Time differences between audio and video (asynchronicity) can have a great impact onlip-reading - with video that lags behind audio having greater negative effect.
End-to-end latency can be a problem in video (sign) communication. Overall delay values below 400 ms are preferred, with an increase in preference down to 100 ms. Overall delay depends on multiple factors, including e.g. network delay and video processing. For this reason a testable requirement on minimum values for overall delay cannot be produced.
**NOTE:** Recommendation ITU-T F.703 defines and gives requirements for Total Conversation that relate to the integration of audio, RTT and video in a single user connection.

### 6.5.2 Resolution
Where ICT that provides two-way voice communication includes real-time video functionality, the ICT:
a. shall support at least QVGA resolution;
b. should preferably support at least VGA resolution.

### 6.5.3 Frame rate
Where ICT that provides two-way voice communication includes real-time video functionality, the ICT:
a. shall support a frame rate of at least 20 Frames Per Second (FPS);
b. should preferably support a frame rate of at least 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) with or without sign language in the video stream.

### 6.5.4 Synchronization between audio and video
Where ICT that provides two-way voice communication includes real-time video functionality, the ICT shall ensure a maximum time difference of 100 ms between the speech and video presented to the user.
**NOTE:** Recent research shows that, if audio leads the video, the intelligibility suffers much more than the reverse.

### 6.5.5 Visual indicator of audio with video
Where ICT provides two-way voice communication, and includes real-time video functionality, the ICT shall provide a real-time visual indicator of audio activity.
**NOTE 1:** The visual indicator may be a simple visual dot or LED, or other type of on/off indicator, that flickers to reflect audio activity.
**NOTE 2:** Without this indication a person who lacks the ability to hear does not know when someone is talking.

### 6.5.6 Speaker identification with video (sign language) communication
Where ICT provides speaker identification for voice users, it shall provide a means for speaker identification for real-time signing and sign language users once the start of signing has been indicated.
**NOTE 1:** The speaker ID can be in the same location as for voice users for multiparty calls.
**NOTE 2:** This mechanism might be triggered manually by a user, or automatically where this is technically achievable.

## 6.6 Alternatives to video-based services
Where ICT provides real-time video-based communication and also provides answering machine, auto attendant or interactive response facilities, the ICT should offer users a means to access the information and carry out the tasks related to these facilities:
a. for audible information, without the use of hearing;
b. for spoken commands, without the use of speech;
c. for visual information, without the use of vision.
**NOTE:** Solutions capable of generating real-time captions or handling RTT could satisfy the above requirement.

# 7 ICT with video capabilities
## 7.1 Caption processing technology
### 7.1.1 Captioning playback
Where ICT displays video with synchronized audio, it shall have a mode of operation to display the available captions. Where closed captions are provided as part of the content, the ICT shall allow the user to choose to display the captions.
**NOTE 1:** Captions may contain information about timing, colour and positioning. This caption data is necessary for caption users. Timing is used for caption synchronization. Colour can be used for speaker identification. Position can be used to avoid obscuring important information.
**NOTE 2:** If a Braille device is connected, the ICT should provide an option to display captions on the Braille device.
**NOTE 3:** Clause 7.1.1 refers to the ability of the player to display captions. Clauses 9.1.2.2, 10.1.2.2 and 11.1.2.2 refer to the provision of captions for the content (the video).

### 7.1.2 Captioning synchronization
Where ICT displays captions, the mechanism to display captions shall preserve synchronization between the audio and the corresponding captions as follows:
* Captions in recorded material: within 100 ms of the time stamp of the caption.
* Live captions: within 100 ms of the availability of the caption to the player.

### 7.1.3 Preservation of captioning
Where ICT transmits, converts or records video with synchronized audio, it shall preserve caption data such that it can be displayed in a manner consistent with clauses 7.1.1 and 7.1.2.
Additional presentational aspects of the text such as screen position, text colours, text style and text fonts may convey meaning, based on regional conventions. Altering these presentational aspects could change the meaning and should be avoided wherever possible.

### 7.1.4 Captions characteristics
Where ICT displays captions, it shall provide a way for the user to adapt the displayed characteristics of captions to their individual requirements, except where the captions are displayed as unmodifiable characters.
**NOTE 1:** Defining the background and foreground colour of subtitles, font type, size opacity of the background box of subtitles, and the contour or border of the fonts can contribute to meeting this requirement.
**NOTE 2:** Subtitles that are bitmap images are examples of unmodifiable characters.

### 7.1.5 Spoken subtitles
Where ICT displays video with synchronized audio, it shall have a mode of operation to provide a spoken output of the available captions, except where the content of the displayed captions is not programmatically determinable.
**NOTE 1:** Being able to manage speech output range for spoken subtitles independently from general ICT speech is preferable for most users. That is possible when the audio file with spoken subtitle is delivered in a separate audio track and mixed in the end users device.
**NOTE 2:** Presenting the separate audio track with spoken subtitles in synchronization with the displayed subtitles/captions improves understandability of the subtitles.
**NOTE 3:** Providing subtitles/captions as separate text-streams, facilitates converting the respective texts into audio.
**NOTE 4:** Subtitles that are bitmap images are examples where the content of the displayed captions will not be programmatically determinable.

## 7.2 Audio description technology
### 7.2.1 Audio description playback
Where ICT displays video with synchronized audio, it shall provide a mechanism to select and play available audio description to the default audio channel.
Where video technologies do not have explicit and separate mechanisms for audio description, an ICT is deemed to satisfy this requirement if the ICT enables the user to select and play several audio tracks.
**NOTE 1:** In such cases, the video content can include the audio description as one of the available audio tracks.
**NOTE 2:** Audio descriptions in digital media sometimes include information to allow descriptions that are longer than the gaps between dialogue. Support in digital media players for this "extended audio description" feature is useful, especially for digital media that is viewed personally.

### 7.2.2 Audio description synchronization
Where ICT has a mechanism to play audio description, it shall preserve the synchronization between the audio/visual content and the corresponding audio description.

### 7.2.3 Preservation of audio description
Where ICT transmits, converts, or records video with synchronized audio, it shall preserve audio description data such that it can be played in a manner consistent with clauses 7.2.1 and 7.2.2.

## 7.3 User controls for captions and audio description
Where ICT primarily displays materials containing video with associated audio content, user controls to activate subtitling and audio description shall be provided to the user at the same level of interaction (i.e. the number of steps to complete the task) as the primary media controls.
**NOTE 1:** Primary media controls are the set of controls that the user most commonly uses to control media.
**NOTE 2:** Products that have a general hardware volume control, such as a telephone, or a laptop which can be configured to display video through software but which is not its primary purpose, would not need dedicated hardware controls for captions and descriptions; however software controls, or hardware controls mapped through software, would need to be at the same level of interaction.
**NOTE 3:** It is best practice for ICT to include additional controls enabling the user to select whether captions and audio description are turned on or off by default.

# 8 Hardware
## 8.1 General
### 8.1.1 Generic requirements
The "generic requirements" of clause 5 also apply to ICT that is hardware.

### 8.1.2 Standard connections
Where an ICT provides user input or output device connection points, the ICT shall provide at least one input and/or output connection that conforms to an industry standard non-proprietary format, directly or through the use of commercially available adapters.
**NOTE 1:** The intent of this requirement is to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies by requiring the use of standard connections on ICT.
**NOTE 2:** The word connection applies to both physical and wireless connections.
**NOTE 3:** Current examples of industry standard non-proprietary formats are USB and Bluetooth.

### 8.1.3 Colour
Where the ICT has hardware aspects that use colour, colour shall not be used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

## 8.2 Hardware products with speech output
### 8.2.1 Speech volume gain
#### 8.2.1.1 Speech volume range
Where ICT hardware has speech output, it shall provide a means to adjust the speech output volume level over a range of at least 18 dB.
**NOTE:** Fixed-line handsets and headsets fulfilling the requirements of ANSI/TIA-4965 are deemed to comply with this requirement.

#### 8.2.1.2 Incremental volume control
Where ICT hardware has speech output and its volume control is incremental, it shall provide at least one intermediate step of 12 dB gain above the lowest volume setting.

### 8.2.2 Magnetic coupling
#### 8.2.2.1 Fixed-line devices
Where ICT hardware is a fixed-line communication device with speech output and which is normally held to the ear, it shall provide a means of magnetic coupling which meets the requirements of ETSI ES 200 381-1 [2] and shall carry the "T" symbol specified in ETSI ETS 300 381 [1].
**NOTE 1:** ICT fulfilling the requirements of TIA-1083-A is deemed to comply with the requirements of this clause.
**NOTE 2:** Magnetic coupling is also known as inductive coupling for T-coil.

#### 8.2.2.2 Wireless communication devices
Where ICT hardware is a wireless communication device with speech output which is normally held to the ear, it shall provide a means of magnetic coupling to hearing technologies which meets the requirements of ETSI ES 200 381-2 [3].
**NOTE:** ICT fulfilling the requirements of ANSI/IEEE C63.19 is deemed to comply with the requirements of this clause.

## 8.3 Stationary ICT
### 8.3.0 General
The present document defines the dimensions for accessing stationary ICT that can be placed in a built environment, but does not define the dimensions of the built environment in general.
The scope includes stationary ICT, of which floors and circulation spaces are "an integral part" (typically kiosks and cabins), and where there are external reach ranges relevant for operating the stationary ICT.
Clauses 8.3.2 to 8.3.4 specify mandatory limits for the maximum and minimum height of operable parts and displays. Based on dimensions shown in Figure 53 of ISO 21542:2011 , it is recommended that the possible height range is reduced to:
* minimum and maximum heights of operable parts: 800 mm and 1 100 mm respectively, and
* minimum and maximum heights of displays: 1 200 mm and 1 400 mm respectively.

### 8.3.1 Forward or side reach
Stationary ICT shall conform to either clause 8.3.2 or clause 8.3.3.
**NOTE 1:** This does not preclude conforming to both clauses.
**NOTE 2:** The dimensions set out in clauses 407.8.3 and 407.8.2 of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as published in January 2017 , are identical to those given in clauses 8.3.2 and 8.3.3 of the present document.
**NOTE 3:** Physical access to stationary ICT is dependent on the dimensions of both the ICT and the environment in which it is installed and operated. Clause 8.3 does not apply to the accessibility of the physical environment external to the ICT.

### 8.3.2 Forward reach
#### 8.3.2.1 Unobstructed high forward reach
Where no part of the stationary ICT obstructs the forward reach, at least one of each type of operable part shall be located no higher than 1 220 mm (48 inches) above the floor of the access space. This is shown in Figure 2.

#### 8.3.2.2 Unobstructed low forward reach
Where no part of the stationary ICT obstructs the forward reach, at least one of each type of operable part shall be located no lower than 380 mm (15 inches) above the floor of the access space. This is shown in Figure 2.

# 9 Web
## 9.0 General (informative)
Requirements in clause 9 apply to web pages (as defined in clause 3.1) including:
* Conformance with W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) Level AA is equivalent to conforming with clauses 9.1.1, 9.1.2, 9.1.3.1 to 9.1.3.3, 9.1.4.1 to 9.1.4.5, 9.2.1.1, 9.2.1.2, 9.2.2, 9.2.3, 9.2.4, 9.3, 9.4.1.1, 9.4.1.2 and the conformance requirements of clause 9.6 of the present document.
* Conformance with W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) [5] Level AA is equivalent to conforming with all of clauses 9.1 to 9.4 and the conformance requirements of clause 9.6 of the present document.
* Requirements for non-web documents and non-web software are given in clauses 10 and 11 respectively.
**NOTE 1:** When evaluating web sites they are evaluated as individual web pages. Web applications, including mobile web applications, are covered under the definition of web page which is quite broad and covers all web content types.
**NOTE 2:** WCAG 2.0 is identical to ISO/IEC 40500:2012: "Information technology - W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0" [4].
The requirements in clauses 9.1 to 9.4 are written using the concept of satisfying success criteria (defined in clause 3.1). A web page satisfies a WCAG success criterion when the success criterion does not evaluate to false when applied to the web page. This implies that if the success criterion puts conditions on a specific feature and that specific feature does not occur in the web page, then the web page satisfies the success criterion.
**NOTE 3:** For example, a web page that does not contain pre-recorded audio content in synchronized media will automatically satisfy WCAG success criterion 1.2.2 (captions - pre-recorded) and, in consequence, will also conform to clause 9.1.2.2.
In addition to Level AA success criteria, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines also include success criteria for Level AAA. These are listed in clause 9.5 of the present document. Web authors and procurement accessibility specialists are encouraged to consider whether any of the WCAG Level AAA success criteria offer suggestions that may be applicable and relevant to their project, as well as potentially beneficial to some users.
**NOTE 4:** The W3C states that "It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content".
**NOTE 5:** "Void" clauses have been inserted in order to maintain alignment with the numbering of WCAG 2.1 Level A and Level AA Success Criteria.

1. Conformance level
2. Full pages
3. Complete processes
4. Only Accessibility-Supported Ways of Using Technologies
5. Non-interference
**NOTE 1:** A Web page that meets all of requirements 9.1 to 9.4, or where a Level AA conforming alternate version (as defined in WCAG 2.1 [5]) is provided, will meet conformance requirement 1.
**NOTE 2:** According to W3C: "WCAG 2.1 extends Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [4], which was published as a W3C Recommendation December 2008. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0, and therefore to policies that reference WCAG 2.0" [4].
**NOTE 3:** Conformance requirement 5 states that all content on the page, including content that is not otherwise relied upon to meet conformance, meets clauses 9.1.4.2, 9.2.1.2, 9.2.2.2 and 9.2.3.1.

# 10 Non-web documents
## 10.0 General (informative)
Requirements in clause 10 apply to:
* documents that are not web pages;
* documents that are not embedded in web pages; and
* documents that are provided with web pages but are neither embedded nor rendered together with the web page from which they are provided (i.e. the present clause applies to downloadable documents).
Clause 9 provides requirements for documents that are in web pages or that are embedded in web pages and that are used in the rendering or that are intended to be rendered together with the web page in which they are embedded.
**NOTE 1:** Some examples of documents are letters, spreadsheets, emails, books, pictures, presentations, and movies that have an associated user agent such as a document reader, editor or media player.
**NOTE 2:** A single document may be composed of multiple files such as the video content and closed caption text. This fact is not usually apparent to the end-user consuming the document/content.
**NOTE 3:** Documents require a user agent in order for the content to be presented to users. The requirements for user agents can be found in clause 11.
**NOTE 4:** The requirements for content that is part of software, can be found in clause 11.
**NOTE 5:** The success criteria set out in clause 10 are intended to harmonize with the Working Group Note produced by the W3C's WCAG2ICT Task Force.
**NOTE 6:** "Void" clauses have been inserted in order to maintain alignment of the numbering in clauses 9, 10 and 11.
**NOTE 7:** Requirements in clause 10 also apply to documents that are protected using mechanisms such as digital signatures, encryption, password protection, and watermarks when they are presented to the user.
**NOTE 8:** It is best practice to provide meta data on the accessibility of the document within or separate to the document using WebSchemas/Accessibility 2.0 .

**NOTE:** The WCAG 2.1 definition of "captions" notes that "in some countries, captions are called subtitles". They are also sometimes referred to as "subtitles for the hearing impaired". Per the definition in WCAG 2.1, to meet this success criterion, whether called captions or subtitles, they would have to provide "synchronized visual and / or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content" where non-speech information includes "sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location".

#### 10.1.2.3 Audio description or media alternative (pre-recorded)
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded).
**NOTE 1:** The WCAG 2.1 definition of "audio description" says that "audio description" is "Also called 'video description' and 'descriptive narration'".
**NOTE 2:** Secondary or alternate audio tracks are commonly used for this purpose.

#### 10.1.2.4 Captions (live)
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.2.4 Captions (Live).
**NOTE:** The WCAG 2.1 definition of "captions" notes that "in some countries, captions are called subtitles". They are also sometimes referred to as "subtitles for the hearing impaired". Per the definition in WCAG 2.1, to meet this success criterion, whether called captions or subtitles, they would have to provide "synchronized visual and / or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content" where non-speech information includes "sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location".

#### 10.1.2.5 Audio description (pre-recorded)
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded).

#### 10.1.4.2 Audio control
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.1.
Table 10.1: Document success criterion: Audio control
If any audio in a document plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.
**NOTE 1:** Since any part of a document that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole document, all content in the document (whether or not it is used to meet other success criteria) shall meet this success criterion.
**NOTE 2:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control, replacing "on a Web page" with "in a document", "any content" with "any part of a document", "whole page" with "whole document", "on the Web page" with "in the document", removing "See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference" and adding note 1.

#### 10.1.4.3 Contrast (minimum)
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum).

#### 10.1.4.4 Resize text
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize Text.
**NOTE 1:** Content for which there are software players, viewers or editors with a 200 percent zoom feature would automatically meet this success criterion when used with such players, unless the content will not work with zoom.
**NOTE 2:** This success criterion is about the ability to allow users to enlarge the text on screen at least up to 200 % without needing to use assistive technologies. This means that the application provides some means for enlarging the text 200 % (zoom or otherwise) without loss of content or functionality or that the application works with the platform features that meet this requirement.
**NOTE 3:** It is best practice to use only fonts that allow for scaling without loss of quality (e.g. pixelized presentation). This applies in particular to embedded fonts.

#### 10.1.4.5 Images of text
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.5 Images of Text.

#### 10.1.4.10 Reflow
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.2.
Table 10.2: Document success criterion: Reflow
Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:
* Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels.
* Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels.
Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.
**NOTE 1:** 320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1 280 CSS pixels wide at 400 % zoom. For documents which are designed to scroll horizontally (e.g. with vertical text), the 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1 024 pixels at 400 % zoom.
**NOTE 2:** Examples of content which require two-dimensional layout are images, maps, diagrams, video, games, presentations, data tables, and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content.
**NOTE 3:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.10 Reflow replacing the original WCAG 2.1 notes with notes 1 and 2, above.

### 10.2.1 Keyboard accessible
#### 10.2.1.1 Keyboard
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard.

#### 10.2.1.2 No keyboard trap
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.3.
Table 10.3: Document success criterion: No keyboard trap
If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the document using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.
**NOTE 1:** Since any part of a document that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole document, it is necessary for all content in the document (whether or not it is used to meet other success criteria) to meet this success criterion.
**NOTE 2:** Standard exit methods may vary by platform. For example, on many desktop platforms, the Escape key is a standard method for exiting.
**NOTE 3:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap replacing "page" and "Web page" with "document", removing "See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference" and with the addition of note 2 above and with note 1 above re-drafted to avoid the use of the word "must".

#### 10.2.1.3 Void
#### 10.2.1.4 Character key shortcuts
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts.

### 10.2.2 Enough time
#### 10.2.2.1 Timing adjustable
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.4.
Table 10.4: Document success criterion: Timing adjustable
For each time limit that is set by the document, at least one of the following is true:
* Turn off: The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or
* Adjust: The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
* Extend: The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or
* Real-time Exception: The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
* Essential Exception: The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
* 20 Hour Exception: The time limit is longer than 20 hours.
**NOTE 1:** This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be considered in conjunction with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.2.1, which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.
**NOTE 2:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable replacing "the content" with "documents" and with the words "WCAG 2.1" added before the word "Success Criterion" in note 1 above.

#### 10.2.2.2 Pause, stop, hide
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.5.
Table 10.5: Document success criterion: Pause, stop, hide
For moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:
* Moving, blinking, scrolling: For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is essential; and
* Auto-updating: For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.
**NOTE 1:** For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to WCAG 2.1 Guideline 2.3.
**NOTE 2:** Since any part of a document that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole document, it is necessary for all content in the document (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) to meet this success criterion.
**NOTE 3:** Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.
**NOTE 4:** An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.
**NOTE 5:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide replacing "page" and "Web page" with "document", removing "See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference" in note 2 of the success criterion, with the words "WCAG 2.1" added before the word "Guideline" in note 1 above and with note 2 above re-drafted to avoid the use of the word "must".

### 10.2.3 Seizures and physical reactions
#### 10.2.3.1 Three flashes or below threshold
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.6.
Table 10.6: Document success criterion: Three flashes or below threshold
Documents do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds.
**NOTE 1:** Since any part of a document that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole document, it is necessary for all content in the document (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) to meet this success criterion.
**NOTE 2:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold replacing "Web pages" with "documents", "the whole page" with "the whole document", "the Web page" with "the document" and removing "See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference" and with note 1 above re-drafted to avoid the use of the word "must".

### 10.2.4 Navigable
#### 10.2.4.1 Void
**NOTE 1:** The related web page requirement "Bypass blocks" does not apply to single documents, but to a specific definition of "sets of documents" that are rare.
**NOTE 2:** Although not a requirement, the ability to bypass blocks of content that are repeated within documents is generally considered best practice and addresses user needs.

#### 10.2.4.2 Document titled
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.7.
Table 10.7: Document success criterion: Document titled
Documents have titles that describe topic or purpose.
**NOTE 1:** The name of a document (e.g. document, media file) is a sufficient title if it describes the topic or purpose.
**NOTE 2:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.2 Page Titled replacing "Web pages" with "documents" and with the addition of note 1 above.

#### 10.2.4.3 Focus Order
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.8.
Table 10.8: Document success criterion: Focus order
If a document can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.
**NOTE:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order replacing "Web page" with "document".

#### 10.2.4.4 Link purpose (in context)
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context).

#### 10.2.4.5 Void
**NOTE:** The related web page requirement "Multiple ways" does not apply to single documents, but to a specific definition of "sets of documents" that are rare.

#### 10.2.4.6 Headings and labels
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.6 Headings and Labels.

#### 10.2.4.7 Focus visible
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.7 Focus Visible.

### 10.2.5 Input modalities
#### 10.2.5.1 Pointer gestures
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.9.
Table 10.9: Document success criterion: Pointer gestures
All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential.
**NOTE 1:** This requirement applies to documents that interpret pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).
**NOTE 2:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures replacing the original WCAG 2.1 note with note 1 above.

#### 10.2.5.2 Pointer cancellation
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.10.
Table 10.10: Document success criterion: Pointer cancellation
For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, at least one of the following is true:
* No Down-Event: The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;
* Abort or Undo: Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;
* Up Reversal: The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;
* Essential: Completing the function on the down-event is essential.
**NOTE 1:** Functions that emulate a keyboard or numeric keypad key press are considered essential.
**NOTE 2:** This requirement applies to a document that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).
**NOTE 3:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation replacing the original WCAG 2.1 note with notes 1 and 2 above.

#### 10.2.5.3 Label in name
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.3 Label in Name.

## 10.3 Understandable
### 10.3.1 Readable
#### 10.3.1.1 Language of document
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.11.
Table 10.11: Document success criterion: Language of document
The default human language of each document can be programmatically determined.
**NOTE:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.1.1 Language of Page replacing "web page" with "document".

#### 10.3.1.2 Language of parts
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.12.
Table 10.12: Document success criterion: Language of parts
The human language of each passage or phrase in the document can be programmatically determined except for proper names, technical terms, words of indeterminate language, and words or phrases that have become part of the vernacular of the immediately surrounding text.
**NOTE 1:** There are some document technologies where there is no assistive technology supported method for marking the language for the different passages or phrases in the document, and it would not be possible to meet this success criterion with those technologies.
**NOTE 2:** Inheritance is one common method. For example a document provides the language that it is using and it can be assumed that all of the text or user interface elements within that document will be using the same language unless it is indicated.
**NOTE 3:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.1.2 Language of Parts replacing "content" with "document" and with the addition of notes 1 and 2 above.

### 10.3.2 Predictable
#### 10.3.2.1 On focus
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.2.1 On Focus.
**NOTE:** Some compound documents and their user agents are designed to provide significantly different viewing and editing functionality depending upon what portion of the compound document is being interacted with (e.g. a presentation that contains an embedded spreadsheet, where the menus and toolbars of the user agent change depending upon whether the user is interacting with the presentation content, or the embedded spreadsheet content). If the user uses a mechanism other than putting focus on that portion of the compound document with which they mean to interact (e.g. by a menu choice or special keyboard gesture), any resulting change of context would not be subject to this success criterion because it was not caused by a change of focus.

#### 10.3.2.2 On input
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.2.2 On Input.

#### 10.3.2.3 Void
**NOTE:** The related web page requirement "Consistent navigation" does not apply to single documents, but to a specific definition of "sets of documents" that are rare.

#### 10.3.3.4 Error prevention (legal, financial, data)
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.13.
Table 10.13: Document success criterion: Error prevention (legal, financial, data)
For documents that cause legal commitments or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete user-controllable data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses, at least one of the following is true:
1. Reversible: Submissions are reversible.
2. Checked: Data entered by the user is checked for input errors and the user is provided an opportunity to correct them.
3. Confirmed: A mechanism is available for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission.
**NOTE:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data) replacing "web pages" with "documents".

## 10.4 Robust
### 10.4.1 Compatible
#### 10.4.1.1 Parsing
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.14.
Table 10.14: Document success criterion: Parsing
For documents that use markup languages, in such a way that the markup is separately exposed and available to assistive technologies and accessibility features of software or to a user-selectable user agent, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.
**NOTE 1:** Start and end tags that are missing a critical character in their formation, such as a closing angle bracket or a mismatched attribute value quotation mark are not complete.
**NOTE 2:** Markup is not always available to assistive technology or to user selectable user agents such as browsers. In such cases, conformance to this [requirement] would have no impact on accessibility as it can for web content where it is exposed.
**NOTE 3:** Examples of markup that is separately exposed and available to assistive technologies and to user agents include but are not limited to: documents encoded in HTML, ODF, and OOXML. In these examples, the markup can be parsed entirely in two ways: (a) by assistive technologies which may directly open the document, (b) by assistive technologies using DOM APIs of user agents for these document formats.
**NOTE 4:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 4.1.1 Parsing replacing "In content implemented using markup languages" with "For documents that use markup languages, in such a way that the markup is separately exposed and available to assistive technologies and accessibility features of software or to a user-selectable user agent" with the addition of notes 2 and 3 above.

#### 10.4.1.2 Name, role, value
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 10.15.
Table 10.15: Document success criterion: Name, role, value
For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.
**NOTE 1:** This success criterion is primarily for software developers who develop or use custom user interface components. Standard user interface components on most accessibility-supported platforms already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.
**NOTE 2:** For document formats that support interoperability with assistive technology, standard user interface components often meet this success criterion when used according to the general design and accessibility guidance for the document format.
**NOTE 3:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value replacing the original WCAG 2.1 note with: "This success criterion is primarily for software developers who develop or use custom user interface components. For example, standard user interface components on most accessibility-supported platforms already meet this success criterion when used according to specification." and with the addition of note 2 above.

#### 10.4.1.3 Status messages
Where ICT is a non-web document, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 4.1.3 Status Messages.

## 10.5 Caption positioning
Where ICT is a non-web document that contains synchronized media with captions, the captions should not obscure relevant information in the synchronized media.

## 10.6 Audio description timing
Where ICT is a non-web document that contains synchronized media with audio description, the audio description should not interfere with relevant audio information in the synchronized media.

# 11 Software
## 11.0 General (informative)
This clause provides requirements for:
* platform software;
* software that provides a user interface including content that is in the software;
* authoring tools;
* software that operates as assistive technology;
* mobile applications.
**NOTE 1:** User agents are examples of software that provide a user interface. They retrieve, render and facilitate end user interaction with authored content. User agents play a necessary role in the accessibility of authored content rendered in the user interface. UAAG 2.0 provides additional advice for those who are creating user agents and want to increase functionality when rendering authored content in an accessible way.
**NOTE 2:** The requirements for Web content, including software that is Web content, can be found in clause 9.
**NOTE 3:** The requirements for documents, that may be presented by user agents, can be found in clause 10.
**NOTE 4:** Although the accessibility of command line interfaces is not dealt with in the present document, accessibility may be achieved by context specific requirements, some of which may be found in clauses 5 or 11.
Requirements in clauses 11.1 to 11.5 apply to software:
* that is not a web page;
* not embedded in web pages nor used in the rendering or functioning of the page.
Clause 9 provides requirements for software that is in web pages or that is embedded in web pages and that is used in the rendering or that is intended to be rendered together with the web page in which it is embedded.
Some requirements in clauses 11.1 to 11.5 have different versions for open or closed functionality. In those cases, the corresponding clause will be divided into two subclauses.
The success criteria set out in clauses 11.1 to 11.5 are intended to harmonize with the W3C Working Group Note produced by the W3C's WCAG2ICT Task Force.
**NOTE 5:** Software that provides a user interface includes its own content. Some examples of content in software include: the controls and text displayed in a menu bar of a graphical user interface application, images that appear in a toolbar, prompts spoken in an auditory user interface, other user interaction controls, and other text, graphics or material that is not loaded from outside the software.
**NOTE 6:** "Void" clauses have been inserted in order to maintain alignment of the numbering in clauses 9, 10 and 11.

## 11.1 Perceivable
### 11.1.1 Text alternatives
#### 11.1.1.1 Non-text content
##### 11.1.1.1.1 Non-text content (open functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface and that supports access to assistive technologies for screen reading, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content.

Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface and that supports access to assistive technologies for screen reading, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded).
**NOTE 1:** The WCAG 2.1 definition of "audio description" says that "audio description" is "also called 'video description' and 'descriptive narration'".
**NOTE 2:** Secondary or alternate audio tracks are commonly used for this purpose.

##### 11.1.2.3.2 Audio description or media alternative (pre-recorded - closed functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface which is closed to assistive technologies for screen reading, it shall meet requirement 5.1.3.7 (Speech output for video information).

#### 11.1.2.4 Captions (live)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.2.4 Captions (Live).
**NOTE:** The WCAG 2.1 definition of "captions" notes that "in some countries, captions are called subtitles". They are also sometimes referred to as "subtitles for the hearing impaired". Per the definition in WCAG 2.1, to meet this success criterion, whether called captions or subtitles, they would have to provide "synchronized visual and / or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content" where non-speech information includes "sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location".

#### 11.1.2.5 Audio description (pre-recorded)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded).
**NOTE 1:** The WCAG 2.1 definition of "audio description" says that audio description is "Also called 'video description' and 'descriptive narration'".
**NOTE 2:** Secondary or alternate audio tracks are commonly used for this purpose.

#### 11.1.3.1 Info and relationships
##### 11.1.3.1.1 Info and relationships (open functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface and that supports access to assistive technologies for screen reading, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships.
**NOTE:** In software, programmatic determinability is best achieved through the use of accessibility services provided by platform software to enable interoperability between software and assistive technologies and accessibility features of software. (see clause 11.5 Interoperability with assistive technology).

##### 11.1.3.1.2 Info and relationships (closed functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface which is closed to assistive technologies for screen reading and where information is displayed on the screen, the ICT should provide auditory information that allows the user to correlate the audio with the information displayed on the screen.
**NOTE 1:** Many people who are legally blind still have visual ability, and use aspects of the visual display even if it cannot be fully comprehended. An audio alternative that is both complete and complementary includes all visual information such as focus or highlighting, so that the audio can be correlated with information that is visible on the screen at any point in time.
**NOTE 2:** Examples of auditory information that allows the user to correlate the audio with the information displayed on the screen include structure and relationships conveyed through presentation.

##### 11.1.3.5.2 Identify input purpose (closed functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface and is closed to assistive technologies, in at least one mode of operation the ICT shall present to the user, in an audio form, the purpose of each input field collecting information about the user when the input field serves a purpose identified in the WCAG 2.1 Input Purposes for User Interface Components section.

### 11.1.4 Distinguishable
#### 11.1.4.1 Use of colour
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.1 Use of Color.

#### 11.1.4.2 Audio control
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 11.1.
Table 11.1: Software success criterion: Audio control
If any audio in a software plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.
**NOTE 1:** Since any part of a software that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole software, all content in the software (whether or not it is used to meet other success criteria) shall meet this success criterion.
**NOTE 2:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control replacing "on a Web page" with "in a software", "any content" with "any part of a software", "whole page" with "whole software", "on the Web page" with "in the software", removing "See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference" and adding note 1.

#### 11.1.4.3 Contrast (minimum)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum).

#### 11.1.4.4 Resize text
##### 11.1.4.4.1 Resize text (open functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface and that supports access to enlargement features of platform or assistive technology, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize Text.
**NOTE 1:** Content for which there are software players, viewers or editors with a 200 percent zoom feature would automatically meet this success criterion when used with such players, unless the content will not work with zoom.
**NOTE 2:** This success criterion is about the ability to allow users to enlarge the text on screen at least up to 200 % without needing to use assistive technologies. This means that the application provides some means for enlarging the text 200 % (zoom or otherwise) without loss of content or functionality or that the application works with the platform features that meet this requirement.

##### 11.1.4.4.2 Resize text (closed functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface which is not able to access the enlargement features of platform or assistive technology, it shall meet requirement 5.1.4 (Functionality closed to text enlargement).
**NOTE:** Because the text rendering support in a closed environment may be more limited than the support found in user agents for the Web, meeting the present clause in a closed environment may place a much heavier burden on the content author.

#### 11.1.4.5 Images of text
##### 11.1.4.5.1 Images of text (open functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface and that supports access to assistive technologies for screen reading, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.5 Images of Text.

#### 11.1.4.7 Void
#### 11.1.4.8 Void
#### 11.1.4.9 Void
#### 11.1.4.10 Reflow
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 11.2.
Table 11.2: Software success criterion: Reflow
Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:
* Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels;
* Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels;
Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.
**NOTE 1:** 320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1 280 CSS pixels wide at 400 % zoom. For non-web software which are designed to scroll horizontally (e.g. with vertical text), the 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1 024 px at 400 % zoom.
**NOTE 2:** Examples of content which require two-dimensional layout are images, maps, diagrams, video, games, presentations, data tables, and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content.
**NOTE 3:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.10 Reflow replacing the original WCAG 2.1 notes with notes 1 and 2, above.

Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast.

#### 11.1.4.12 Text spacing
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface and that does not have a fixed size content layout area that is essential to the information being conveyed, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.12 Text spacing.

#### 11.1.4.13 Content on hover or focus
Where ICT is a non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.13 Content on hover or focus.

## 11.2 Operable
### 11.2.1 Keyboard accessible
#### 11.2.1.1 Keyboard
##### 11.2.1.1.1 Keyboard (open functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface and that supports access to keyboards or a keyboard interface, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard.
**NOTE:** This does not imply that software is required to directly support a keyboard or "keyboard interface". Nor does it imply that software is required to provide a soft keyboard. Underlying platform software may provide device independent input services to applications that enable operation via a keyboard. Software that supports operation via such platform device independent services would be operable by a keyboard and would comply.

##### 11.2.1.1.2 Keyboard (closed functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface which is closed to keyboards or keyboard interface, it shall meet requirement 5.1.6.1 (Operation without keyboard interface: Closed functionality).

#### 11.2.1.2 No keyboard trap
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 11.3.
Table 11.3: Software success criterion: No keyboard trap
If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the software using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.
**NOTE 1:** Since any part of a software that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole software, it is necessary for all content in the software (whether or not it is used to meet other success criteria) to meet this success criterion.
**NOTE 2:** Standard exit methods may vary by platform. For example, on many desktop platforms, the Escape key is a standard method for exiting.
**NOTE 3:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap replacing "content", "page" and "Web page" with "software", removing "See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference" and with the addition of note 2 above and with note 1 above re-drafted to avoid the use of the word "shall".

#### 11.2.1.3 Void
#### 11.2.1.4 Character key shortcuts
##### 11.2.1.4.1 Character key shortcuts (open functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts.

##### 11.2.1.4.2 Character key shortcuts (closed functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface which is closed to keyboards or keyboard interface, it shall meet requirement 5.1.6.1 (Operation without keyboard interface: Closed functionality).

### 11.2.2 Enough time
#### 11.2.2.1 Timing adjustable
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 11.4.
Table 11.4: Software success criterion: Timing adjustable
For each time limit that is set by the software, at least one of the following is true:
* Turn off: The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or
* Adjust: The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
* Extend: The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or
* Real-time Exception: The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
* Essential Exception: The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
* 20 Hour Exception: The time limit is longer than 20 hours.
**NOTE 1:** This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be considered in conjunction with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.2.1, which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.
**NOTE 2:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable replacing "the content" with "software" and with the words "WCAG 2.1" added before the word "Success Criterion" in note 1 above.

#### 11.2.2.2 Pause, stop, hide
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 11.5.
Table 11.5: Software success criterion: Pause, stop, hide
For moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:
* Moving, blinking, scrolling: For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is essential; and
* Auto-updating: For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.
**NOTE 1:** For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to WCAG 2.1 Guideline 2.3.
**NOTE 2:** This success criteria is applicable to all content in the software (whether or not there is an alternate accessible mode of operation of the software) since any part of a software that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole software (including a user interface element that enables the user to activate the alternate accessible mode of operation).
**NOTE 3:** Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.
**NOTE 4:** An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.
**NOTE 5:** This is to be applied to all content. Any content, whether informative or decorative, that is updated automatically, blinks, or moves may create an accessibility barrier.
**NOTE 6:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide replacing "page" and "Web page" with "software", removing "See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference" in note 2 of the success criterion, with the words "WCAG 2.1" added before the word "Guideline" in note 1 above, with note 2 above re-drafted to avoid the use of the word "must" and with the addition of note 5 above.

### 11.2.3 Seizures and physical reactions
#### 11.2.3.1 Three flashes or below threshold
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 11.6.
Table 11.6: Software success criterion: Three flashes or below threshold
Software does not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds.
**NOTE 1:** This success criteria is applicable to all content in the software (whether or not there is an alternate accessible mode of operation of the software) since any part of a software that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole software (including a user interface element that enables the user to activate the alternate accessible mode of operation).
**NOTE 2:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold replacing "Web pages" with "software", "the whole page" with "the whole software", "the Web page" with "the software" and removing "See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference" and with note 1 above re-drafted to avoid the use of the word "must".

### 11.2.4 Navigable
#### 11.2.4.1 Void
**NOTE 1:** The related web page requirement "Bypass blocks" does not apply to single software programs, but to a specific definition of "sets of software programs" that are extremely rare.
**NOTE 2:** Although not a requirement, it is generally considered best practice, and to address user needs, to be able to bypass blocks of content that are repeated within software.

#### 11.2.4.2 Void
**NOTE 1:** The related web page requirement "Page titled" does not apply to single software programs, but to a specific definition of "sets of software programs" that are extremely rare.
**NOTE 2:** Although the name of a software product could be a sufficient title if it describes the topic or purpose, software names are trademarked and trademark names cannot by law be descriptive names. It is not practical to make software names both unique and descriptive.

#### 11.2.4.3 Focus order
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 11.7.
Table 11.7: Software success criterion: Focus order
If software can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.
**NOTE:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.3 Focus order replacing "Web page" with "software".

#### 11.2.4.4 Link purpose (in context)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context).

#### 11.2.4.5 Void
**NOTE:** The related web page requirement for "Multiple ways" applies to "Sets" of web pages. In software, the equivalent to "sets of web pages" would be "sets of software", but these are extremely rare and an equivalent is not included in this clause on software requirements.

#### 11.2.4.6 Headings and labels
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.6 Headings and Labels.
**NOTE:** In software, headings and labels are used to describe sections of content and controls respectively. In some cases it may be unclear whether a piece of static text is a heading or a label. But whether treated as a label or a heading, the requirement is the same: that if they are present they describe the topic or purpose of the item(s) they are associated with.

#### 11.2.4.7 Focus visible
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.7 Focus Visible.

### 11.2.5 Input modalities
#### 11.2.5.1 Pointer gestures
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 11.8.
Table 11.8: Software success criterion: Pointer gestures
All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential.
**NOTE 1:** This requirement applies to non-web software that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).
**NOTE 2:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures replacing the original WCAG 2.1 note with note 1 above.

#### 11.2.5.2 Pointer cancellation
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 11.9.
Table 11.9: Software success criterion: Pointer cancellation
For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, at least one of the following is true:
* No Down-Event: The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function.
* Abort or Undo: Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion.
* Up Reversal: The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event.
* Essential: Completing the function on the down-event is essential.
**NOTE 1:** Functions that emulate a keyboard or numeric keypad key press are considered essential.
**NOTE 2:** This requirement applies to non-web software that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).
**NOTE 3:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation replacing the original WCAG 2.1 note with notes 1 and 2 above.

#### 11.2.5.3 Label in name
##### 11.2.5.3.1 Label in name (open functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.3 Label in Name.

Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.4 Motion Actuation.

## 11.3 Understandable
### 11.3.1 Readable
#### 11.3.1.1 Language of software
##### 11.3.1.1.1 Language of software (open functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface and that supports access to assistive technologies for screen reading, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 11.10.
Table 11.10: Software success criterion: Language of software
The default human language of software can be programmatically determined.
**NOTE 1:** Where software platforms provide a "locale / language" setting, applications that use that setting and render their interface in that "locale / language" would comply with this success criterion. Applications that do not use the platform "locale / language" setting but instead use an accessibility-supported method for exposing the human language of the software would also comply with this success criterion. Applications implemented in technologies where assistive technologies cannot determine the human language and that do not support the platform "locale / language" setting may not be able to meet this success criterion in that locale / language.
**NOTE 2:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.1.1 Language of page, replacing "each web page" with "software" and with the addition of note 1 above.

##### 11.3.1.1.2 Language of software (closed functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface which is closed to assistive technologies for screen reading, it shall meet requirement 5.1.3.14 (Spoken languages).

#### 11.3.1.2 Void
**NOTE:** To apply the related web page requirement for "Language of parts" to software would require the marking-up of all text in all locations within the software. This would be impossible so an equivalent is not included in this clause on software requirements.

### 11.3.2 Predictable
#### 11.3.2.1 On focus
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.2.1 On Focus.
**NOTE:** Some compound documents and their user agents are designed to provide significantly different viewing and editing functionality depending upon what portion of the compound document is being interacted with (e.g. a presentation that contains an embedded spreadsheet, where the menus and toolbars of the user agent change depending upon whether the user is interacting with the presentation content, or the embedded spreadsheet content). If the user uses a mechanism other than putting focus on that portion of the compound document with which they mean to interact (e.g. by a menu choice or special keyboard gesture), any resulting change of context would not be subject to this success criterion because it was not caused by a change of focus.

#### 11.3.2.2 On input
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.2.2 On Input.

#### 11.3.2.3 Void
**NOTE:** The related web page requirement for "Consistent navigation" applies to "Sets" of web pages. While consistency within software is desirable, "sets of software" in the same sense as "sets of web pages", are extremely rare and an equivalent is not included in this clause on software requirements.

#### 11.3.2.4 Void
**NOTE:** The related web page requirement for "Consistent identification" applies to "Sets" of web pages. In software, the equivalent to "sets of web pages" would be "sets of software", but these are extremely rare and an equivalent is not included in this clause on software requirements.

### 11.3.3 Input assistance

Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions.

#### 11.3.3.3 Error suggestion
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.3.3 Error Suggestion.

#### 11.3.3.4 Error prevention (legal, financial, data)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 11.11.
Table 11.11: Software success criterion: Error prevention (legal, financial, data)
For software that cause legal commitments or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete user-controllable data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses, at least one of the following is true:
1. Reversible: Submissions are reversible.
2. Checked: Data entered by the user is checked for input errors and the user is provided an opportunity to correct them.
3. Confirmed: A mechanism is available for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission.
**NOTE:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data) replacing "web pages" with "software".

## 11.4 Robust
### 11.4.1 Compatible
#### 11.4.1.1 Parsing
##### 11.4.1.1.1 Parsing (open functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface and that supports access to any assistive technologies, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 11.12.
Table 11.12: Software success criterion: Parsing
For software that uses markup languages, in such a way that the markup is separately exposed and available to assistive technologies and accessibility features of software or to a user-selectable user agent, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.
**NOTE 1:** Start and end tags that are missing a critical character in their formation, such as a closing angle bracket or a mismatched attribute value quotation mark are not complete.
**NOTE 2:** Markup is not always available to assistive technology or to user selectable user agents such as browsers. In such cases, conformance to this [requirement] would have no impact on accessibility as it can for web content where it is exposed.
**NOTE 3:** Examples of markup that is separately exposed and available to assistive technologies and to user agents include but are not limited to: documents encoded in HTML, ODF, and OOXML. In these examples, the markup can be parsed entirely in two ways: (a) by assistive technologies which may directly open the document, (b) by assistive technologies using DOM APIs of user agents for these document formats.
**NOTE 4:** Examples of markup used internally for persistence of the software user interface that are never exposed to assistive technology include but are not limited to: XUL, and FXML. In these examples assistive technology only interacts with the user interface of generated software.
**NOTE 5:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 4.1.1 Parsing replacing "In content implemented using markup languages" with "For software that uses markup languages, in such a way that the markup is separately exposed and available to assistive technologies and accessibility features of software or to a user-selectable user agent" with the addition of notes 2, 3 and 4 above.

##### 11.4.1.1.2 Parsing (closed functionality)
Not applicable.
**NOTE:** Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface which is closed to all assistive technology it does not have to meet the "Parsing" success criterion in Table 11.12 because the intent of this success criterion is to provide consistency so that different user agents or assistive technologies will yield the same result.

Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface and that supports access to any assistive technologies, it shall satisfy the success criterion in Table 11.13.
Table 11.13: Software success criterion: Name, role, value
For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.
**NOTE 1:** This success criterion is primarily for software developers who develop or use custom user interface components. Standard user interface components on most accessibility-supported platforms already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.
**NOTE 2:** For conforming to this success criterion, it is usually best practice for software user interfaces to use the accessibility services provided by platform software. These accessibility services enable interoperability between software user interfaces and both assistive technologies and accessibility features of software in standardised ways. Most platform accessibility services go beyond programmatic exposure of name and role, and programmatic setting of states, properties and values (and notification of same), and specify additional information that could or should be exposed and / or set (for instance, a list of the available actions for a given user interface component, and a means to programmatically execute one of the listed actions).
**NOTE 3:** This success criterion is identical to the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value replacing the original WCAG 2.1 note with: "This success criterion is primarily for software developers who develop or use custom user interface components. Standard user interface components on most accessibility-supported platforms already meet this success criterion when used according to specification." and the addition of note 2 above.

##### 11.4.1.2.2 Name, role, value (closed functionality)
Not applicable.
**NOTE:** Where ICT is non-web software that provides a user interface which is closed to all assistive technology it does not have to meet the "Name, role, value" success criterion in Table 11.13 because this success criterion requires information in a programmatically determinable form.

#### 11.4.1.3 Status messages
##### 11.4.1.3.1 Status messages (open functionality)
Where ICT is non-web software, it shall satisfy WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 4.1.3 Status Messages.

##### 11.4.1.3.2 Status messages (closed functionality)
Not applicable.

## 11.5 Interoperability with assistive technology
### 11.5.1 Closed functionality
Where the closed functionality of software conforms to clause 5.1 (Closed functionality) it shall not be required to conform with clause 11.5.2 to clause 11.5.2.17.

### 11.5.2 Accessibility services
#### 11.5.2.1 Platform accessibility service support for software that provides a user interface
Platform software shall provide a set of documented platform services that enable software that provides a user interface running on the platform software to interoperate with assistive technology.
Where a user interface concept corresponding to one of the clauses 11.5.2.5 to 11.5.2.17 is supported within the software environment, the platform software should support that requirement. For example, selection attributes from clause 11.5.2.14 (Modification of focus and selection attributes) may not exist in environments that do not allow selection, which is most commonly associated with copy and paste.
**NOTE 1:** These define the minimum functionality of software providing user interfaces when using platform services.
**NOTE 2:** In some platforms these services may be called accessibility services, but in some other platforms these services may be provided as part of the user interface services.
**NOTE 3:** User interface services that provide accessibility support by default are considered to be part of the services provided to conform to this clause (e.g. the service for creating a new user interface element provides role, state, boundary, name and description).
**NOTE 4:** To comply with this requirement the platform software can provide its own set of services or expose the services provided by its underlying platform layers, if those services conform to this requirement.
**NOTE 5:** Within specific programming environments, the technical attributes associated with the user interface properties described in clauses 11.5.2.5 to 11.5.2.17 might have different names than those used within the clauses.

#### 11.5.2.2 Platform accessibility service support for assistive technologies
Platform software shall provide a set of documented platform accessibility services that enable assistive technology to interoperate with software that provides a user interface running on the platform software.
Where a user interface concept corresponding to one of the clauses 11.5.2.5 to 11.5.2.17 is supported within the software environment, the platform software should support that requirement. For example, selection attributes from clause 11.5.2.14 (Modification of focus and selection attributes) may not exist in environments that do not allow selection, which is most commonly associated with copy and paste.
**NOTE 1:** These define the minimum functionality available to assistive technologies when using platform services.
**NOTE 2:** The definition of platform in clause 3.1 applies to software that provides services to other software, including but not limited to, operating systems, web browsers, virtual machines.
**NOTE 3:** In some platforms these services may be called accessibility services, but in some other platforms these services may be provided as part of the user interface services.
**NOTE 4:** Typically these services belong to the same set of services that are described in clause 11.5.2.1.
**NOTE 5:** To comply with this requirement the platform software can provide its own set of services or expose the services provided by its underlying platform layers, if those services conform to this requirement.

#### 11.5.2.3 Use of accessibility services
Where the software provides a user interface it shall use the applicable documented platform accessibility services. If the documented platform accessibility services do not allow the software to meet the applicable requirements of clauses 11.5.2.5 to 11.5.2.17, then software that provides a user interface shall use other documented services to interoperate with assistive technology.
**NOTE:** The term "documented platform accessibility services" refers to the set of services provided by the platform according to clauses 11.5.2.1 and 11.5.2.2.
It is best practice to develop software using toolkits that automatically implement the underlying platform accessibility services.

#### 11.5.2.4 Assistive technology
Where the ICT is assistive technology it shall use the documented platform accessibility services.
**NOTE 1:** The term "documented platform accessibility services" refers to the set of services provided by the platform according to clauses 11.5.2.1 and 11.5.2.2.
**NOTE 2:** Assistive technology can also use other documented accessibility services.

#### 11.5.2.5 Object information
Where the software provides a user interface it shall, by using the services as described in clause 11.5.2.3, make the user interface elements' role, state(s), boundary, name, and description programmatically determinable by assistive technologies.

#### 11.5.2.6 Row, column, and headers
Where the software provides a user interface it shall, by using the services as described in clause 11.5.2.3, make the row and column of each cell in a data table, including headers of the row and column if present, programmatically determinable by assistive technologies.

#### 11.5.2.7 Values
Where the software provides a user interface, it shall, by using the services as described in clause 11.5.2.3, make the current value of a user interface element and any minimum or maximum values of the range, if the user interface element conveys information about a range of values, programmatically determinable by assistive technologies.

#### 11.5.2.8 Label relationships
Where the software provides a user interface it shall expose the relationship that a user interface element has as a label for another element, or of being labelled by another element, using the services as described in clause 11.5.2.3, so that this information is programmatically determinable by assistive technologies.

#### 11.5.2.9 Parent-child relationships
Where the software provides a user interface it shall, by using the services as described in clause 11.5.2.3, make the relationship between a user interface element and any parent or children elements programmatically determinable by assistive technologies.

#### 11.5.2.10 Text
Where the software provides a user interface it shall, by using the services as described in clause 11.5.2.3, make the text contents, text attributes, and the boundary of text rendered to the screen programmatically determinable by assistive technologies.

#### 11.5.2.11 List of available actions
Where the software provides a user interface it shall, by using the services as described in clause 11.5.2.3, make a list of available actions that can be executed on a user interface element, programmatically determinable by assistive technologies.

#### 11.5.2.12 Execution of available actions
Where permitted by security requirements, software that provides a user interface shall, by using the services as described in clause 11.5.2.3, allow the programmatic execution of the actions exposed according to clause 11.5.2.11 by assistive technologies.
**NOTE 1:** In some cases the security requirements imposed on a software product may forbid external software from interfering with the ICT product. Examples of systems under strict security requirements are systems dealing with intelligence activities, cryptologic activities related to national security, command and control of military forces.
**NOTE 2:** Assistive technologies may be required to maintain the same level of security as the standard input mechanisms supported by the platform.

#### 11.5.2.13 Tracking of focus and selection attributes
Where software provides a user interface it shall, by using the services as described in clause 11.5.2.3, make information and mechanisms necessary to track focus, text insertion point, and selection attributes of user interface elements programmatically determinable by assistive technologies.

#### 11.5.2.14 Modification of focus and selection attributes
Where permitted by security requirements, software that provides a user interface shall, by using the services as described in clause 11.5.2.3, allow assistive technologies to programmatically modify focus, text insertion point, and selection attributes of user interface elements where the user can modify these items.
**NOTE 1:** In some cases the security requirements imposed on a software product may forbid external software from interfering with the ICT product and so this requirement would not apply. Examples of systems under strict security requirements are systems dealing with intelligence activities, cryptologic activities related to national security, command and control of military forces.
**NOTE 2:** Assistive technologies may be required to maintain the same level of security as the standard input mechanisms supported by the platform.

#### 11.5.2.15 Change notification
Where software provides a user interface it shall, by using the services as described in clause 11.5.2.3, notify assistive technologies about changes in those programmatically determinable attributes of user interface elements that are referenced in requirements 11.5.2.5 to 11.5.2.11 and 11.5.2.13.

#### 11.5.2.16 Modifications of states and properties
Where permitted by security requirements, software that provides a user interface shall, by using the services as described in clause 11.5.2.3, allow assistive technologies to programmatically modify states and properties of user interface elements, where the user can modify these items.
**NOTE 1:** In some cases the security requirements imposed on a software product may forbid external software from interfering with the ICT product and so this requirement would not apply. Examples of systems under strict security requirements are systems dealing with intelligence activities, cryptologic activities related to national security, command and control of military forces.
**NOTE 2:** Assistive technologies may be required to maintain the same level of security as the standard input mechanisms supported by the platform.

#### 11.5.2.17 Modifications of values and text
Where permitted by security requirements, software that provides a user interface shall, by using the services as described in clause 11.5.2.3, allow assistive technologies to modify values and text of user interface elements using the input methods of the platform, where a user can modify these items without the use of assistive technology.
**NOTE 1:** In some cases the security requirements imposed on a software product may forbid external software from interfering with the ICT product and so this requirement would not apply. Examples of systems under strict security requirements are systems dealing with intelligence activities, cryptologic activities related to national security, command and control of military forces.
**NOTE 2:** Assistive technologies may be required to maintain the same level of security as the standard input mechanisms supported by the platform.

## 11.6 Documented accessibility usage
### 11.6.1 User control of accessibility features
Where software is a platform it shall provide sufficient modes of operation for user control over those platform accessibility features documented as intended for users.

### 11.6.2 No disruption of accessibility features
Where software provides a user interface it shall not disrupt those documented accessibility features that are defined in platform documentation except when requested to do so by the user during the operation of the software.

## 11.7 User preferences
Where software is not designed to be isolated from its platform, and provides a user interface, that user interface shall follow the values of the user preferences for platform settings for: units of measurement, colour, contrast, font type, font size, and focus cursor except where they are overridden by the user.
**NOTE 1:** Software that is isolated from its underlying platform has no access to user settings in the platform and thus cannot adhere to them.
**NOTE 2:** For web content, the underlying platform is the user agent.
**NOTE 3:** This does not preclude the software from having additional values for a setting as long as there is one mode where the application will follow the system settings even if more restricted.

## 11.8 Authoring tools
### 11.8.0 General (informative)
For those creating web content authoring tools, ATAG 2.0 provides information that can be of interest to those who want to go beyond these requirements.
**NOTE:** This is applicable both to standalone and to web based authoring tools.

### 11.8.1 Content technology
Authoring tools shall conform to clauses 11.8.2 to 11.8.5 to the extent that information required for accessibility is supported by the format used for the output of the authoring tool.

### 11.8.2 Accessible content creation
Authoring tools shall enable and guide the production of content that conforms to clauses 9 (Web content) or 10 (Non-Web content) as applicable.
**NOTE:** Authoring tools may rely on additional tools where conformance with specific requirements is not achievable by a single tool. For example, a video editing tool may enable the creation of video files for distribution via broadcast television and the web, but authoring of caption files for multiple formats may be provided by a different tool.

### 11.8.3 Preservation of accessibility information in transformations
If the authoring tool provides restructuring transformations or re-coding transformations, then accessibility information shall be preserved in the output if equivalent mechanisms exist in the content technology of the output.
**NOTE 1:** Restructuring transformations are transformations in which the content technology stays the same, but the structural features of the content are changed (e.g. linearizing tables, splitting a document into pages).
**NOTE 2:** Re-coding transformations are transformations in which the technology used to encode the content is changed.

### 11.8.4 Repair assistance
If the accessibility checking functionality of an authoring tool can detect that content does not meet a requirement of clauses 9 (Web) or 10 (Non-web documents) as applicable, then the authoring tool shall provide repair suggestion(s).
**NOTE:** This does not preclude automated and semi-automated repair which is possible (and encouraged) for many types of content accessibility problems.

### 11.8.5 Templates
When an authoring tool provides templates, at least one template that supports the creation of content that conforms to the requirements of clauses 9 (Web) or 10 (Non-web documents) as applicable shall be available and identified as such.

# 12 Documentation and support services
## 12.1 Product documentation
### 12.1.1 Accessibility and compatibility features
Product documentation provided with the ICT whether provided separately or integrated within the ICT shall list and explain how to use the accessibility and compatibility features of the ICT.
**NOTE 1:** Accessibility and compatibility features include accessibility features that are built-in and accessibility features that provide compatibility with assistive technology.
**NOTE 2:** It is best practice to use WebSchemas/Accessibility 2.0 to provide meta data on the accessibility of the ICT.
**NOTE 3:** The accessibility statement and help pages are both examples of the provision of product information.

### 12.1.2 Accessible documentation
Product documentation provided with the ICT shall be made available in at least one of the following electronic formats:
a. a Web format that conforms to the requirements of clause 9; or
b. a non-web format that conforms to the requirements of clause 10.
**NOTE 1:** This does not preclude the possibility of also providing the product documentation in other formats (electronic, printed or audio) that are not accessible.
**NOTE 2:** It also does not preclude the possibility of providing alternate formats that meet the needs of some specific type of users (e.g. Braille documents for blind people or easy-to-read information for persons with limited cognitive, language and learning abilities).
**NOTE 3:** Where documentation is incorporated into the ICT, the documentation falls under the requirements for accessibility in the present document.
**NOTE 4:** A user agent that supports automatic media conversion would be beneficial to enhancing accessibility.

## 12.2 Support services
### 12.2.1 General (informative)
ICT support services include, but are not limited to: help desks, call centres, technical support, relay services and training services.

### 12.2.2 Information on accessibility and compatibility features
ICT support services shall provide information on the accessibility and compatibility features that are mentioned in the product documentation.
**NOTE:** Accessibility and compatibility features include accessibility features that are built-in and accessibility features that provide compatibility with assistive technology.

### 12.2.3 Effective communication
ICT support services shall accommodate the communication needs of individuals with disabilities either directly or through a referral point.

### 12.2.4 Accessible documentation
Documentation provided by support services shall be made available in at least one of the following electronic formats:
a. a Web format that conforms to clause 9; or
b. a non-web format that conforms to clause 10.
**NOTE 1:** This does not preclude the possibility of also providing the documentation in other formats (electronic or printed) that are not accessible.
**NOTE 2:** It also does not preclude the possibility of providing alternate formats that meet the needs of some specific type of users (e.g. Braille documents for blind people or easy-to-read information for persons with limited cognitive, language and learning abilities).
**NOTE 3:** Where the support documentation is incorporated into the ICT, the documentation falls under the requirements for accessibility in the present document.
**NOTE 4:** A user agent that supports automatic media conversion would be beneficial to enhancing accessibility.

# 13 ICT providing relay or emergency service access
## 13.1 Relay services requirements
### 13.1.1 General (informative)
Relay services enable users of different modes of communication e.g. text, sign, speech, to interact remotely through ICT with two-way communication by providing conversion between the modes of communication, normally by a human operator.
It is best practice to meet the applicable relay service requirements of ETSI ES 202 975 .

### 13.1.2 Text relay services
Where ICT is intended to provide a text relay service, the text relay service shall enable text users and speech users to interact by providing conversion between the two modes of communication.

### 13.1.3 Sign relay services
Where ICT is intended to provide a sign relay service, the sign relay service shall enable sign language users and speech users to interact by providing conversion between the two modes of communication.
**NOTE:** Sign relay services are also sometimes referred to as sign language relay services or video relay services.

### 13.1.4 Lip-reading relay services
Where ICT is intended to provide a lip-reading relay service, the lip-reading service shall enable lip-readers and voice telephone users to interact by providing conversion between the two modes of communication.

### 13.1.5 Captioned telephony services
Where ICT is intended to provide a captioned telephony service, the captioned telephony service shall assist a deaf or hard of hearing user in a spoken dialogue by providing text captions translating the incoming part of the conversation.

### 13.1.6 Speech to speech relay services
Where ICT is intended to provide a speech to speech relay service, the speech to speech relay service shall enable telephone users who are speech impaired, have limited cognitive, language and learning abilities, as well as any other user, to communicate by providing assistance between them.

## 13.2 Access to relay services
Where ICT systems support two-way communication, and the system is specified for use with relay services, access to those relay services shall not be prevented for outgoing and incoming calls involving: voice, RTT, or video, either individually or in combinations supported by both the relay service and the ICT system.
**NOTE 1:** The purpose of this requirement is to achieve functionally equivalent communication access by persons with disabilities.
**NOTE 2:** The system may be specified as needing to work with relay services by, for example: procurers, regulators, or product specifications.

## 13.3 Access to emergency services
Where ICT systems support two-way communication, and the system is specified for use with emergency services, access to those emergency services shall not be prevented for outgoing and incoming calls involving: voice, RTT, or video, either individually or in combinations supported by both the emergency service and the ICT system.
**NOTE 1:** The purpose of this requirement is to achieve functionally equivalent communication access to the emergency service by persons with disabilities.
**NOTE 2:** The system may be specified as needing to work with emergency services by, for example: procurers, regulators, or product specifications.

# 14 Conformance
Conformance to the present document is achieved by meeting all the applicable requirements, these are clauses containing the word "shall". Those clauses containing the word "should" are recommendations and are not required for conformance.
All clauses except those in clause 12 are self-scoping. This means they are introduced with the phrase 'Where ICT <pre condition>'. A requirement is met when the pre-condition is true and the corresponding test (in Annex C) is passed. When one of the pre-conditions is false the requirement is not applicable. Consequently, the result of the tests in Annex C can be: not applicable, pass, fail, or (in exceptional circumstances) not testable.
ICT is often comprised of an assembly of two or more items of ICT. In some cases, two or more interoperable items of ICT may together meet more requirements of the standard when one item complements the functionality of the other and the sum together meets more of the accessibility requirements. However, combining two items of ICT, both of which fail to meet any particular requirement, will not lead to a combined ICT system that meets that requirement.
The present document does not prioritize requirements.
**NOTE 1:** Conformance with the accessibility requirements could be affected by subsequent implementation or maintenance.
**NOTE 2:** Sampling is frequently required on complex ICT when there are too many instances of the object to be tested. The present document cannot recommend specific ICT evaluation sampling techniques as these are context specific.
The inherent nature of certain situations makes it impossible to make reliable and definitive statements that accessibility requirements have been met. In those situations therefore, the requirements in the present document are not applicable:
* when the product is in a failure, repair or maintenance state where the ordinary set of input or output functions are not available;
* during those parts of start-up, shutdown, and other state transitions that can be completed without user interaction.
**NOTE 3:** Even in the above situations, it is best practice to apply requirements in the present document wherever it is feasible and safe to do so.
